@article{Dotu19908358,
	Abstract = {We describe several dynamic programming segmentation algorithms to segment RNA secondary and tertiary structures into distinct domains. For this purpose, we consider fitness functions that variously depend on (i) base pairing probabilities in the Boltzmann low energy ensemble of structures, (ii) contact maps inferred from 3-dimensional structures, and (iii) Voronoi tessellation computed from 3-dimensional structures. Segmentation algorithms include a direct dynamic programming method, previously discovered by Bellman and by Finkelstein and Roytberg, as well as two novel algorithms - a parametric algorithm to compute the optimal segmentation into k classes, for each value k, and an algorithm that simultaneously computes the optimal segmentation of all subsegments. Since many non-coding RNA gene finders scan the genome by a moving window method, reporting high-scoring windows, we apply structural segmentation to determine the most likely 5' and 3' boundaries of precursor microRNAs. When tested on all precursor microRNAs of length at most 100 nt from the Rfam database, benchmarking studies indicate that segmentation determines the 5' boundary with discrepancy (absolute value of difference between predicted and real boundaries) having mean -0.640 (stdev 15.196) and the 3' boundary with discrepancy having mean -0.266 (stdev. 17.415). This yields a sensitivity of 0.911 and positive predictive value of 0.906 for determination of exact boundaries of precursor microRNAs within a window of approximately 900 nt. Additionally, by comparing the manual segmentation of Jaeger et al. with our optimal structural segmentation of 16S and 16S-like rRNA of E. coli, rat mitochondria, Halobacterium volcanii, and Chlamydomonas reinhardii chloroplast into 4 segments, we establish the usefulness of (automated) structural segmentation in decomposing large RNA structures into distinct domains.},

@article{Gardner15860779,
	Abstract = {To date, few attempts have been made to benchmark the alignment algorithms upon nucleic acid sequences. Frequently, sophisticated PAM or BLOSUM like models are used to align proteins, yet equivalents are not considered for nucleic acids; instead, rather ad hoc models are generally favoured. Here, we systematically test the performance of existing alignment algorithms on structural RNAs. This work was aimed at achieving the following goals: (i) to determine conditions where it is appropriate to apply common sequence alignment methods to the structural RNA alignment problem. This indicates where and when researchers should consider augmenting the alignment process with auxiliary information, such as secondary structure and (ii) to determine which sequence alignment algorithms perform well under the broadest range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment alone, using the current algorithms, is generally inappropriate <50-60\% sequence identity. Second, we note that the probabilistic method ProAlign and the aging Clustal algorithms generally outperform other sequence-based algorithms, under the broadest range of applications.},

	Abstract = {Large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are pervasively transcribed in the genome yet their potential involvement in human disease is not well understood. Recent studies of dosage compensation, imprinting, and homeotic gene expression suggest that individual lincRNAs can function as the interface between DNA and specific chromatin remodelling activities. Here we show that lincRNAs in the HOX loci become systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression. The lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast tumours and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumours is a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness, particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. These findings indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering according to sequence-structure similarity has now become a generally accepted scheme for ncRNA annotation. Its application to complete genomic sequences as well as whole transcriptomes is therefore desirable but hindered by extremely high computational costs. RESULTS: We present a novel linear-time, alignment-free method for comparing and clustering RNAs according to sequence and structure. The approach scales to datasets of hundreds of thousands of sequences. The quality of the retrieved clusters has been benchmarked against known ncRNA datasets and is comparable to state-of-the-art sequence-structure methods although achieving speedups of several orders of magnitude. A selection of applications aiming at the detection of novel structural ncRNAs are presented. Exemplarily, we predicted local structural elements specific to lincRNAs likely functionally associating involved transcripts to vital processes of the human nervous system. In total, we predicted 349 local structural RNA elements. AVAILABILITY: The GraphClust pipeline is available on request.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many computerized methods for RNA secondary structure prediction have been developed. Few of these methods, however, employ an evolutionary model, thus relevant information is often left out from the structure determination. This paper introduces a method which incorporates evolutionary history into RNA secondary structure prediction. The method reported here is based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) to give a prior probability distribution of structures. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree relating the sequences can be found by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation from the model introduced here. The tree is shown to reveal information about the structure, due to mutation patterns. The inclusion of a prior distribution of RNA structures ensures good structure predictions even for a small number of related sequences. Prediction is carried out using maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) estimation in a Bayesian approach. For small sequence sets, the method performs very well compared to current automated methods.},

	Abstract = {A novel application of dynamic programming to the folding problem for RNA enables one to calculate the full equilibrium partition function for secondary structure and the probabilities of various substructures. In particular, both the partition function and the probabilities of all base pairs are computed by a recursive scheme of polynomial order N3 in the sequence length N. The temperature dependence of the partition function gives information about melting behavior for the secondary structure. The pair binding probabilities, the computation of which depends on the partition function, are visually summarized in a "box matrix" display and this provides a useful tool for examining the full ensemble of probable alternative equilibrium structures. The calculation of this ensemble representation allows a proper application and assessment of the predictive power of the secondary structure method, and yields important information on alternatives and intermediates in addition to local information about base pair opening and slippage. The results are illustrated for representative tRNA, 5S RNA, and self-replicating and self-splicing RNA molecules, and allow a direct comparison with enzymatic structure probes. The effect of changes in the thermodynamic parameters on the equilibrium ensemble provides a further sensitivity check to the predictions. ------------------------------ Remark: error in equation (7) - term for internal loops must be multiplied by Qb[h][l]},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries of a large variety of important roles for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been reported by numerous researchers. In order to analyze ncRNAs by kernel methods including support vector machines, we propose stem kernels as an extension of string kernels for measuring the similarities between two RNA sequences from the viewpoint of secondary structures. However, applying stem kernels directly to large data sets of ncRNAs is impractical due to their computational complexity. RESULTS: We have developed a new technique based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) derived from base-pairing probability matrices of RNA sequences that significantly increases the computation speed of stem kernels. Furthermore, we propose profile-profile stem kernels for multiple alignments of RNA sequences which utilize base-pairing probability matrices for multiple alignments instead of those for individual sequences. Our kernels outperformed the existing methods with respect to the detection of known ncRNAs and kernel hierarchical clustering. CONCLUSION: Stem kernels can be utilized as a reliable similarity measure of structural RNAs, and can be used in various kernel-based applications.},

	Abstract = {Computational methods for determining the secondary structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding, compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.},

@article{Sorescu2012,
	Abstract = {Due to recent algorithmic progress, tools for the gold standard of comparative RNA analysis, namely Sankoff-style simultaneous alignment and folding, are now readily applicable. Such approaches, however, compare RNAs with respect to a simultaneously predicted, single, nested consensus structure. To make multiple alignment of RNAs available in cases, where this limitation of the standard approach is critical, we introduce a web server that provides a complete and convenient interface to the RNA structure alignment tool 'CARNA'. This tool uniquely supports RNAs with multiple conserved structures per RNA and aligns pseudoknots intrinsically; these features are highly desirable for aligning riboswitches, RNAs with conserved folding pathways, or pseudoknots. We represent structural input and output information as base pair probability dot plots; this provides large flexibility in the input, ranging from fixed structures to structure ensembles, and enables immediate visual analysis of the results. In contrast to conventional Sankoff-style approaches, 'CARNA' optimizes all structural similarities in the input simultaneously, for example across an entire RNA structure ensemble. Even compared with already costly Sankoff-style alignment, 'CARNA' solves an intrinsically much harder problem by applying advanced, constraint-based, algorithmic techniques. Although 'CARNA' is specialized to the alignment of RNAs with several conserved structures, its performance on RNAs in general is on par with state-of-the-art general-purpose RNA alignment tools, as we show in a Bralibase 2.1 benchmark.

@article{Will17432929,
	Abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

@article{Muckstein12385998,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The level of sequence conservation between related
nucleic acids or proteins often varies considerably along the
sequence. Both regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots)
and regions of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the
same pair of molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore
strongly depends on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially
in regions of high variability, many alignments of almost equal
quality exist, and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary.
RESULTS: We discuss two approaches which deal with the inherent
ambiguity of the alignment problem based on the computation of
the partition function over all canonical pairwise alignments.
The ensemble of possible alignments can be described by the probabilities
P(ij) of a  match between position i in the first and position
j in the second sequence. Alternatively, we introduce a probabilistic
backtracking procedure that generates ensembles of suboptimal
alignments with correct statistical weights. A comparison between
structure based alignments and large samples of stochastic alignments
shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments with significant
probabilities even though the optimal alignment deviates significantly
from the structural alignment. Ensembles of suboptimal alignments
obtained by stochastic backtracking can be used as input to any
bioinformatics method based on pairwise  alignment in order to
gain reliability information not available from a single optimal
alignment. AVAILABILITY: The software described in this contribution

@article{Dalli16613908,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alignment of RNA has a wide range of applications,
for example in phylogeny inference, consensus structure prediction
and homology searches. Yet aligning structural or non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) correctly is notoriously difficult as these RNA sequences
may evolve by compensatory mutations, which maintain base pairing
but destroy sequence homology. Ideally, alignment programs  would
take RNA structure into account. The Sankoff algorithm for the
simultaneous solution of RNA structure prediction and RNA sequence
alignment was proposed 20 years ago but suffers from its exponential
complexity. A number of programs implement lightweight versions
of the Sankoff algorithm by restricting its application to a limited
type of structure and/or only pairwise alignment. Thus,  despite
recent advances, the proper alignment of multiple structural RNA
sequences remains a problem. RESULTS: Here we present StrAl, a
heuristic method for alignment of ncRNA that reduces sequence-structure
alignment to a two-dimensional problem similar to standard multiple
sequence alignment. The scoring function takes into account sequence
similarity as well as up- and downstream pairing probability.
To test the robustness of the algorithm and the performance of
the program, we scored alignments produced by StrAl against a
large set of published reference alignments. The quality of alignments
predicted  by StrAl is far better than that obtained by standard
sequence alignment programs, especially when sequence homologies
drop below approximately 65\%; nevertheless StrAl's runtime is
comparable to that of ClustalW.},
