	Abstract = {We describe several dynamic programming segmentation algorithms to segment RNA secondary and tertiary structures into distinct domains. For this purpose, we consider fitness functions that variously depend on (i) base pairing probabilities in the Boltzmann low energy ensemble of structures, (ii) contact maps inferred from 3-dimensional structures, and (iii) Voronoi tessellation computed from 3-dimensional structures. Segmentation algorithms include a direct dynamic programming method, previously discovered by Bellman and by Finkelstein and Roytberg, as well as two novel algorithms - a parametric algorithm to compute the optimal segmentation into k classes, for each value k, and an algorithm that simultaneously computes the optimal segmentation of all subsegments. Since many non-coding RNA gene finders scan the genome by a moving window method, reporting high-scoring windows, we apply structural segmentation to determine the most likely 5' and 3' boundaries of precursor microRNAs. When tested on all precursor microRNAs of length at most 100 nt from the Rfam database, benchmarking studies indicate that segmentation determines the 5' boundary with discrepancy (absolute value of difference between predicted and real boundaries) having mean -0.640 (stdev 15.196) and the 3' boundary with discrepancy having mean -0.266 (stdev. 17.415). This yields a sensitivity of 0.911 and positive predictive value of 0.906 for determination of exact boundaries of precursor microRNAs within a window of approximately 900 nt. Additionally, by comparing the manual segmentation of Jaeger et al. with our optimal structural segmentation of 16S and 16S-like rRNA of E. coli, rat mitochondria, Halobacterium volcanii, and Chlamydomonas reinhardii chloroplast into 4 segments, we establish the usefulness of (automated) structural segmentation in decomposing large RNA structures into distinct domains.},

Frequently, sophisticated PAM or BLOSUM like models are used to align proteins, yet equivalents are not considered for nucleic acids; instead, rather ad hoc models are generally favoured. Here, we systematically test the performance of existing alignment algorithms on structural RNAs. This work was aimed at achieving the following goals: (i) to determine conditions where it is appropriate to apply common sequence alignment methods to the structural RNA alignment problem. This indicates where and when researchers should consider augmenting the alignment process with auxiliary information, such as secondary structure and (ii) to determine which sequence alignment algorithms perform well under the broadest range of conditions. We find that sequence alignment alone, using the current algorithms, is generally inappropriate <50-60\% sequence identity. Second, we note that the probabilistic method ProAlign and the aging Clustal algorithms generally outperform other sequence-based algorithms, under the broadest range of applications.},

Recent studies of dosage compensation, imprinting, and homeotic gene expression suggest that individual lincRNAs can function as the interface between DNA and specific chromatin remodelling activities. Here we show that lincRNAs in the HOX loci become systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression. The lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast tumours and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumours is a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness, particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. These findings indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.},

Reliable multiple alignments can therefore be constructed only when the shared structural features are taken into account. Since multiple alignments are used as input for many subsequent methods of data analysis, structure-based alignments are an indispensable necessity in RNA bioinformatics. RESULTS: We present here a method to compute pairwise and progressive multiple alignments from the direct comparison of base pairing probability matrices. Instead of attempting to solve the folding and the alignment problem simultaneously as in the classical Sankoff's algorithm, we use McCaskill's approach to compute base pairing probability matrices which effectively incorporate the information on the energetics of each sequences. A novel, simplified variant of Sankoff's algorithms can then be employed to extract the maximum-weight common secondary structure and an associated alignment.

Few of these methods, however, employ an evolutionary model, thus relevant information is often left out from the structure determination. This paper introduces a method which incorporates evolutionary history into RNA secondary structure prediction. The method reported here is based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) to give a prior probability distribution of structures. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree relating the sequences can be found by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation from the model introduced here. The tree is shown to reveal information about the structure, due to mutation patterns. The inclusion of a prior distribution of RNA structures ensures good structure predictions even for a small number of related sequences. Prediction is carried out using maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) estimation in a Bayesian approach. For small sequence sets, the method performs very well compared to current automated methods.},

	Abstract = {A novel application of dynamic programming to the folding problem for RNA enables one to calculate the full equilibrium partition function for secondary structure and the probabilities of various substructures. In particular, both the partition function and the probabilities of all base pairs are computed by a recursive scheme of polynomial order N3 in the sequence length N. The temperature dependence of the partition function gives information about melting behavior for the secondary structure. The pair binding probabilities, the computation of which depends on the partition function, are visually summarized in a "box matrix" display and this provides a useful tool for examining the full ensemble of probable alternative equilibrium structures. The calculation of this ensemble representation allows a proper application and assessment of the predictive power of the secondary structure method, and yields important information on alternatives and intermediates in addition to local information about base pair opening and slippage. The results are illustrated for representative tRNA, 5S RNA, and self-replicating and self-splicing RNA molecules, and allow a direct comparison with enzymatic structure probes. The effect of changes in the thermodynamic parameters on the equilibrium ensemble provides a further sensitivity check to the predictions. ------------------------------ Remark: error in equation (7) - term for internal loops must be multiplied by Qb[h][l]},

In order to analyze ncRNAs by kernel methods including support vector machines, we propose stem kernels as an extension of string kernels for measuring the similarities between two RNA sequences from the viewpoint of secondary structures. However, applying stem kernels directly to large data sets of ncRNAs is impractical due to their computational complexity. RESULTS: We have developed a new technique based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) derived from base-pairing probability matrices of RNA sequences that significantly increases the computation speed of stem kernels. Furthermore, we propose profile-profile stem kernels for multiple alignments of RNA sequences which utilize base-pairing probability matrices for multiple alignments instead of those for individual sequences. Our kernels outperformed the existing methods with respect to the detection of known ncRNAs and kernel hierarchical clustering. CONCLUSION: Stem kernels can be utilized as a reliable similarity measure of structural RNAs, and can be used in various kernel-based applications.},

	Abstract = {Computational methods for determining the secondary structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding, compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.},

	Abstract = {Due to recent algorithmic progress, tools for the gold standard of comparative RNA analysis, namely Sankoff-style simultaneous alignment and folding, are now readily applicable. Such approaches, however, compare RNAs with respect to a simultaneously predicted, single, nested consensus structure. To make multiple alignment of RNAs available in cases, where this limitation of the standard approach is critical, we introduce a web server that provides a complete and convenient interface to the RNA structure alignment tool 'CARNA'. This tool uniquely supports RNAs with multiple conserved structures per RNA and aligns pseudoknots intrinsically; these features are highly desirable for aligning riboswitches, RNAs with conserved folding pathways, or pseudoknots. We represent structural input and output information as base pair probability dot plots; this provides large flexibility in the input, ranging from fixed structures to structure ensembles, and enables immediate visual analysis of the results. In contrast to conventional Sankoff-style approaches, 'CARNA' optimizes all structural similarities in the input simultaneously, for example across an entire RNA structure ensemble. Even compared with already costly Sankoff-style alignment, 'CARNA' solves an intrinsically much harder problem by applying advanced, constraint-based, algorithmic techniques. Although 'CARNA' is specialized to the alignment of RNAs with several conserved structures, its performance on RNAs in general is on par with state-of-the-art general-purpose RNA alignment tools, as we show in a Bralibase 2.1 benchmark.

	Abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The level of sequence conservation between related
nucleic acids or proteins often varies considerably along the
sequence. Both regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots)
and regions of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the
same pair of molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore
strongly depends on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially
in regions of high variability, many alignments of almost equal
quality exist, and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary.
RESULTS: We discuss two approaches which deal with the inherent
ambiguity of the alignment problem based on the computation of
the partition function over all canonical pairwise alignments.
The ensemble of possible alignments can be described by the probabilities
P(ij) of a  match between position i in the first and position
j in the second sequence. Alternatively, we introduce a probabilistic
backtracking procedure that generates ensembles of suboptimal
alignments with correct statistical weights. A comparison between
structure based alignments and large samples of stochastic alignments
shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments with significant
probabilities even though the optimal alignment deviates significantly
from the structural alignment. Ensembles of suboptimal alignments
obtained by stochastic backtracking can be used as input to any
bioinformatics method based on pairwise  alignment in order to
gain reliability information not available from a single optimal
alignment. AVAILABILITY: The software described in this contribution

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alignment of RNA has a wide range of applications,
for example in phylogeny inference, consensus structure prediction
and homology searches. Yet aligning structural or non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) correctly is notoriously difficult as these RNA sequences
may evolve by compensatory mutations, which maintain base pairing
but destroy sequence homology. Ideally, alignment programs  would
take RNA structure into account. The Sankoff algorithm for the
simultaneous solution of RNA structure prediction and RNA sequence
alignment was proposed 20 years ago but suffers from its exponential
complexity. A number of programs implement lightweight versions
of the Sankoff algorithm by restricting its application to a limited
type of structure and/or only pairwise alignment. Thus,  despite
recent advances, the proper alignment of multiple structural RNA
sequences remains a problem. RESULTS: Here we present StrAl, a
heuristic method for alignment of ncRNA that reduces sequence-structure
alignment to a two-dimensional problem similar to standard multiple
sequence alignment. The scoring function takes into account sequence
similarity as well as up- and downstream pairing probability.
To test the robustness of the algorithm and the performance of
the program, we scored alignments produced by StrAl against a
large set of published reference alignments. The quality of alignments
predicted  by StrAl is far better than that obtained by standard
sequence alignment programs, especially when sequence homologies
drop below approximately 65\%; nevertheless StrAl's runtime is
comparable to that of ClustalW.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many RNA molecules, secondary structure rather
than primary sequence is the evolutionarily conserved feature.
No programs have yet been published that allow searching a sequence
database for homologs of a single RNA molecule on the basis of
secondary structure. RESULTS: We have developed a program, RSEARCH,
that takes a single RNA sequence with its secondary structure
and utilizes a local alignment algorithm to search a database
for homologous RNAs. For this purpose, we have developed a series
of base pair and single nucleotide substitution matrices for RNA
sequences called RIBOSUM matrices. RSEARCH reports the statistical
confidence for each hit as well as the structural alignment of
the hit. We show several examples in which RSEARCH outperforms
the primary sequence search programs BLAST and SSEARCH. The primary
drawback of the program is that it is slow. The C code for RSEARCH
is freely available from our lab's website. CONCLUSION: RSEARCH
outperforms primary sequence programs in finding homologs of structured
RNA sequences.},

@article{Middleton25234928,
	Abstract = {Structures that recur across multiple different transcripts, called
structure motifs, often perform a similar function-for example,
recruiting a specific RNA-binding protein that then regulates
translation, splicing, or subcellular localization. Identifying
common motifs between coregulated transcripts may therefore yield
significant insight into their binding partners and mechanism
of  regulation. However, as most methods for clustering structures
are based on folding individual sequences or doing many pairwise
alignments, this results in a tradeoff between speed and accuracy
that can be problematic for large-scale data  sets. Here we describe
a novel method for comparing and characterizing RNA secondary
structures that does not require folding or pairwise alignment
of the input sequences. Our method uses the idea of constructing
a distance function between two objects by their respective distances
to a collection of empirical examples or models, which in our
case consists of 1973 Rfam family covariance models. Using this
as a basis for measuring structural similarity, we developed a
clustering pipeline called NoFold to automatically identify and
annotate structure motifs within large sequence data sets. We
demonstrate that NoFold can  simultaneously identify multiple
structure motifs with an average sensitivity of  0.80 and precision
of 0.98 and generally exceeds the performance of existing methods.
We also perform a cross-validation analysis of the entire set
of Rfam families, achieving an average sensitivity of 0.57. We
apply NoFold to identify motifs enriched in dendritically localized
transcripts and report 213 enriched motifs, including both known
and novel structures.},

@article{Miladi28334186,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Clustering RNA sequences with common secondary structure
is an essential step towards studying RNA function. Whereas structural
RNA alignment strategies typically identify common structure for
orthologous structured RNAs, clustering seeks to group paralogous
RNAs based on structural similarities. However, existing approaches
for clustering paralogous RNAs, do not take the compensatory base
pair changes obtained from structure conservation in orthologous
sequences into account. Results: Here, we present RNAscClust,
the implementation of a new algorithm to cluster a set of structured
RNAs taking their respective structural conservation into account.
For a set of multiple structural alignments of RNA sequences,
each containing a paralog sequence included in a structural alignment
of its orthologs, RNAscClust computes minimum  free-energy structures
for each sequence using conserved base pairs as prior information
for the folding. The paralogs are then clustered using a graph
kernel-based strategy, which identifies common structural features.We
show that the clustering accuracy clearly benefits from an increasing
degree of compensatory base pair changes in the alignments. Availability:

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The maximum expected accuracy optimization criterion
for multiple sequence alignment uses pairwise posterior probabilities
of residues to align sequences. The partition function methodology
is one way of estimating these probabilities. Here, we combine
these two ideas for the first time to construct maximal expected
accuracy sequence alignments. RESULTS: We bridge the two techniques
within the program Probalign. Our results indicate that Probalign
alignments are generally more accurate than other leading multiple
sequence alignment methods (i.e. Probcons, MAFFT and MUSCLE) on
the BAliBASE 3.0 protein alignment benchmark. Similarly, Probalign
also outperforms these methods on the HOMSTRAD and OXBENCH benchmarks.
Probalign ranks statistically highest (P-value < 0.005) on all
three benchmarks. Deeper scrutiny of the technique indicates that
the improvements are largest on datasets containing N/C-terminal
extensions and on datasets containing long and heterogeneous length
proteins. These points are demonstrated on both real and simulated
data. Finally, our method also produces accurate alignments on
long and heterogeneous length datasets containing protein  repeats.
Here, alignment accuracy scores are at least 10\% and 15\% higher
than the other three methods when standard deviation of length
is >300 and 400, respectively. AVAILABILITY: Open source code

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate
level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating
part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution,

Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic

pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties. RESULTS:
The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA
secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades.
Major changes in the  structure of the standard energy model,
the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs,
and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major
technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive
user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of
tools to assess RNA-RNA  interactions and restricted ensembles
of structures, additional output information such as centroid
structures and maximum expected accuracy structures  derived from
base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary
structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were
implemented without compromising the computational efficiency
of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier
versions. CONCLUSIONS: The ViennaRNA Package  2.0, supporting

@article{Havgaard17937495,
	Abstract = {It has become clear that noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) play important
roles in cells, and emerging studies indicate that there might
be a large number of unknown ncRNAs in mammalian genomes. There
exist computational methods that can be used to search for ncRNAs
by comparing sequences from different genomes. One main problem
with these methods is their computational complexity, and heuristics
are  therefore employed. Two heuristics are currently very popular:
pre-folding and pre-aligning. However, these heuristics are not
ideal, as pre-aligning is dependent on sequence similarity that
may not be present and pre-folding ignores  the comparative information.
Here, pruning of the dynamical programming matrix is presented
as an alternative novel heuristic constraint. All subalignments
that do not exceed a length-dependent minimum score are discarded
as the matrix is filled out, thus giving the advantage of providing
the constraints dynamically. This has been included in a new implementation
of the FOLDALIGN algorithm for pairwise local or global structural
alignment of RNA sequences. It is shown that time and  memory
requirements are dramatically lowered while overall performance
is maintained. Furthermore, a new divide and conquer method is
introduced to limit the memory requirement during global alignment
and backtrack of local alignment.  All branch points in the computed
RNA structure are found and used to divide the  structure into
smaller unbranched segments. Each segment is then realigned and
backtracked in a normal fashion. Finally, the FOLDALIGN algorithm
has also been updated with a better memory implementation and
an improved energy model. With these improvements in the algorithm,
the FOLDALIGN software package provides the  molecular biologist
with an efficient and user-friendly tool for searching for new
ncRNAs. The software package is available for download at \verb+http://foldalign.ku.dk+.},
